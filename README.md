# GitHub Repo Search

GitHub Repo Search is a simple React app that allows users to search for a GitHub user's repositories and displays the repositories sorted by stars. The app filters out forked repositories and allows users to sort the results by more or fewer stars. It also provides pagination for easy navigation.

## Installation

### 1.Clone the repository:
First of all, you need to clone this repository on your device. To do that, you have to follow 
this steps:
  -Open your console where you want your repository cloned.
  -Copy this exact line: git clone https://github.com/plrmnts/react-github-challenge.git
  -When you press enter, it will start copying everything in the repository to your device (it can take a few minutes, but it'll be worth it)

Everything done? Awesome! Let's see what's next

### 2. Navigate to the project folder:
  -Now we have to go to the actual project folder, but don't worry, is very simple, just copy the next line:
   cd react-github-challenge

### 3.Install the dependencies:

  In this step, you will install everything in your device that is needed for the project to run smoothly:
   -All you have to do is type "npm install" in the console you're working on and hit enter. This can also take a moment, but is a very important step!

## Starting the app

  Finally! We're in the best part:
    -To start the app just type "npm run".
    -This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000/. The server will probably open by itself, but if not, don't panic! Open this URL: http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to view and interact with the app.

## Enjoy!

  This is a very simple app, but I had a lot of fun playing around with the posibilities and the design. I know there's a lot more that can be done but please note that this is an application for a challenge, so I decided to keep it simple!
